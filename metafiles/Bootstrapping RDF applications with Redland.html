Introduction</a></h2><p>Redland is a mature Free Software / Open Source library written in C
designed to enable RDF support in existing applications and to provide
a way for new RDF-based applications to be built easily.  Ease for
applications developer here means that the average programmer
should be able to pick up the library and in an afternoon be able to
get the job done in a screenful of code at most.  This meant Redland
had to be usable from a wide variety of programming languages, be
portable and flexible in using whatever functionality a wide variety
of open systems provide, and be licensed such that it could work with
many users.
</p><p>Any required external libraries have to be widely available
where critical - Redland's key requirements are an XML parser
- where it allows either expat or libxml to be used which are
widely available - and some me sort of persistent store where
there are many choices.  The optional parts appear in Redland
as modules or in object terms, multiple implementations of
interfaces that provide parsers, serialisers, triple stores,
query languages and so on.
</p><p>The portability and flexible configuration was aided by the
use of the GNU autotools for discovering and enabling the
features available on individual systems.  automake,
autoconf, and libtool (although quite complex in themselves)
enable the portable use of very system-specific detail such as
shared-library / DLL / OSX framework, bundle, module, dynamic loading
to be removed from the main codebase.
</p><p>One major consideration is what licenses the free software / open
source software <acronym class="acronym">FS/OSS</acronym> is under.  Most developers
are either using or familiar with the GNU GPL, so Redland is available
under a compatible license set - the LGPL/GPL dual license.  This is
not always a suitable license, so a third alternative is the Apache
2.0 license which is used by a large number of projects from the
Apache Foundation including the well known HTTP server.
</p><p>Documentation is another consideration in ensuring easy access to
software.  All the Redland libraries have news, release notes, and
detailed changelogs and also include reference documentation which
needs to be kept in synchronisation with the code in order to be
useful.  The main Redland RDF API ensures this by creating
documentation derived directly from the C sources in a Javadoc-style,
building DocBook XML, that builds into an HTML API or PDF reference.
Raptor and Rasqal have detailed Unix manual page for the smaller
APIs, as do each of the command line utilities.  All of the APIs and
language bindings come with examples and some have individual test
suites (Perl, Python, C#).  All of this is available in each release
and is the main content that builds the Redland web site.  The
missing parts at present in documentation terms are tutorials and
comprehensive examples of the entire API, although some of the test
suite do exercise the majority of the API and provides useful example
code.
</p></div><div class="section"><hr><h2 class="section"><a name="sec-design">2. Design approach of Redland</a></h2><p>Redland was designed as a family of four C libraries covering
major parts of the functionality.
</p><p></p><div class="variablelist"><p><b>Redland Components</b></p><dl><dt>Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit<a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#Raptor">[Raptor]</a></dt><dd><p>parsing, serialising, URIs, WWW
retrieval, Unicode and XML</p></dd><dt>Rasqal RDF Query Library<a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#Rasqal">[Rasqal]</a></dt><dd><p>query syntax support and query

Raptor and Rasqal)</p></dd><dt>Redland Bindings<a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#Bindings">[Bindings]</a></dt><dd><p>language bindings to Redland (using Redland)
</p></dd></dl></div><p>This split allowed development of the libraries to proceed at different
rates, and to concentrate specific detail on one technology such as
XML into just one place (Raptor, for parsing and serialising).  This
also allowed useful subsets of the full library set to be available
and to enable separate use without the full Redland RDF API.
In particular parsing (Raptor) and querying (Rasqal) are used in
external applications to interoperate.  An application can use
Raptor alone to get RDF data in and out from syntaxes without
having to even have any RDF processing or understanding in the code.
(The command-line user need not even learn the RDF API of Redland,
as the parsing, querying and API calls can be done from simple
RDF utility programs, one for each library.)
</p><p>The language bindings are a separate part so that those developers
that just need a C, C++ or related language (Obj-C) interface do not
need to use them.  When these are packaged up into binary packages as
done for Linux, they are split into further per-language packages, so
that the minimum number of libraries need be installed by a developer
starting from a set of compiled binary packages.
</p><p>The Redland API library (aka librdf) uses and wraps all the
functionality that Raptor and Rasqal deliver, and adds the extra
RDF-specific functionality of storing RDF graphs, manipulating them
and making a full and coherent user RDF API above the parsing and
querying libraries.  To a user of a language binding above the RDF
API, the distinction between Raptor, Rasqal and Redland itself is
not noticeable in normal use.
</p></div><div class="section"><hr><h2 class="section"><a name="sec-objects-in-c">3. Redland API style - Object-based in C</a></h2><p>Every web programming language provides access to C and most
desktop applications are still written in C / C++.  
Thus to provide access across multiple systems and languages,
the Redland libraries were written in portable ANSI C99. 
This however, did not mean that the API needed to be solely a set of
functions in the single flat namespace that C provides.  This would
deliver a unnatural API when reflected into other language bindings.
As not all web languages are based on an object model, C provides a
better basis than C++ (which requires objects) to deliver a
consistent API that does not require object support in the language.
</p><p>Redland provides an object model in C with constructor functions,
destructor functions and method functions that can be accessed via
any language that can call C.  Languages such as Tcl where there are
no objects can use them without need for further work, and those
where object support is evolving such as moving from PHP3 to PHP4 to
PHP5 can use them or not as the versions and support
provides.  Languages with objects such as Perl, Python and C# can map
the Redland objects can be mapped to match language concepts.
</p><p>In Redland a class called <span class="emphasis"><i class="emphasis">FOO</i></span> is defined as a C
typedef <tt class="literal">librdf_foo</tt>. The constructors for the
class are defined as functions with signatures like:
</p><pre class="programlisting">  librdf_foo* librdf_new_foo(void)
</pre><p>which takes no parameters.  Constructors usually have parameters and
are named in a similar way with an extra part appropriate for the
name for example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">  librdf_foo* librdf_new_foo_with_options(char *options)
</pre><p>A copy constructor may also be defined which has a signature:</p><pre class="programlisting">  librdf_foo* librdf_new_foo_from_foo(librdf_foo* old_foo)
</pre><p>A destructor is always defined with the function signature:</p><pre class="programlisting">  void librdf_free_foo(librdf_foo* foo)
</pre><p>Methods of the class have names starting with
<tt class="literal">librdf_foo_</tt> and examples could be:
</p><pre class="programlisting">  /* accessor functions to object part 'thing' */
  int librdf_foo_set_thing(librdf_foo* foo, char *thing)
  char *librdf_foo_get_thing(librdf_foo* foo)
</pre><p>Clearly there can be no inheritance or method overloading using this
model.  Redland handles this by having interface classes such as
storage that have multiple implementations for the classes that
implement the storage 'interface'.  In the language bindings, native
inheritance can be used to provide convenience wrapper classes, such
as a particular storage implementation.
</p><p>Compiling in C provides a RDF core library with high performance,
small memory footprint and low memory use, especially with the
Redland use of streaming explained later.  There are of course
several downsides to using C that are well known - the memory
management and absence of OO support features like reference
counting, exceptions and proper strings in the language.
</p><p>To try to reduce these problems as much as possible, Redland
undergoes lots of testing especially by the use of debugging malloc
systems and processor memory simulators such as Valgrind <a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#Valgrind">[Valgrind]</a>. Each Redland C module also comes with multiple
built in unit-tests.
</p><p>Redland is regularly built and tested on over a dozen different Linux
/ Unix systems from BSDen to Solaris and architectures (such as the
11 architectures supported by Debian GNU/Linux) and is also built on
Apple OSX and Win32 by external users.  Redland is automatically
tested using the SourceForge compile farm to track build and test
failures, and a bug tracker used to follow up user reports.
</p></div><div class="section"><hr><h2 class="section"><a name="sec-bindings">4. Language Bindings to C</a></h2><p>There are several common web development languages that operate on
a dynamic scripting model such as Perl, Python and Ruby.  These present
a class and object model to the user, which can map to Redland's model.
Redland uses swig<a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#SWIG">[SWIG]</a> to generate bindings to
these scripting languages based on a pseudo-C description.  It
generates the interface C code to do the marshalling/unmarshalling
of arguments to functions and their  return values along with whatever
type-checking is possible.  This allows concentrating on encoding
more natural bindings on top of the raw SWIG conversion of the functions,
to use the different features in the language bindings.
</p><p>The class <span class="emphasis"><i class="emphasis">foo</i></span> with a
constructor, destructor and two methods could
mapped as shown in <a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#objectsinc-ex">Example 1</a>:
</p><div class="example"><a name="objectsinc-ex"></a><p><b>Example 1. Functions for Redland Objects in C for class <span class="emphasis"><i class="emphasis">foo</i></span></b></p><pre class="programlisting">  librdf_foo* librdf_new_foo(void);

  void librdf_free_foo(librdf_foo* foo);

  int librdf_foo_set_thing(librdf_foo* foo, char *thing);
  char *librdf_foo_get_thing(librdf_foo* foo);
</pre></div><p>SWIG would convert that into similar-named functions that would
be callable in the target binding language, converting the
<tt class="literal">librdf_foo</tt> typedef into a typed object
pointer which the marshalling code would check.
</p><p>This would not look like objects to the target language, so
all the Redland bindings that map to object-based languages
provide wrapper classes.   In Python it would be
something like in <a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#pythonfoo-ex">Example 2</a> where SWIG presents
the mapped functions as appearing in the Redland class:
</p><div class="example"><a name="pythonfoo-ex"></a><p><b>Example 2. Python binding for the class <span class="emphasis"><i class="emphasis">foo</i></span></b></p><pre class="programlisting">  class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
      self._native=Redland.librdf_new_foo()

    def __del__(self):
      Redland.librdf_free_foo(self._native)

    def set_thing(self, value):
      return Redland.librdf_foo_set_thing(self._native, value)

    def thing(self):
    return Redland.librdf_foo_get_thing(self._native)
</pre></div><p>So to the Python programmer, the Redland implementation detail is
lost and it looks and works like a regular python class as shown
in <a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#python-ex">Example 3</a>:
</p><div class="example"><a name="python-ex"></a><p><b>Example 3. Python example</b></p><pre class="programlisting">  import RDF

  foo=RDF.Foo()
  foo.set_thing("blah")
  print foo.thing()
</pre></div><p>This scheme has been fully implemented for the core binding languages
for Redland - Python, Perl, Ruby.  C# has it's own equivalent to
SWIG and calls C directly but the wrapper classes work in the same fashion.
Tcl and PHP remain flat functional mappings and Java although using
this scheme, is not a core binding language for Redland.  An third
party maintainer has developed Objective-C bindings in the same fashion
for OSX.
</p><p>Each language requires it's own additional customisation for
individual features that are in one language but not another, such as
using Python generators to wrap Redland iterators, Perl arrays around
lists or detail with the additional management aspects that occur
near strings and Unicode.
</p></div><div class="section"><hr><h2 class="section"><a name="sec-data">5. RDF Input, Output and Storage</a></h2><p>It is important that it is easy for data to be easily input and
output from a system and Redland provides multiple (7+) parsers and
serialisers (3+) operating on syntaxes.  The parsers can read RDF
syntaxes such as RDF/XML and generate RDF triples, the serialisers do
the reverse and generate syntaxes from an RDF graph.  These are
integrated into the API so that reading and writing to and from
strings, local files and URIs is a single method call.
</p><p>However not all data is neatly stored in RDF files, so Redland
includes two parsers that allow manipulating of the input form
into RDF triples - an RSS tag soup parser that can read most any
version of "RSS" up to and including the ongoing Atom work, 
and a GRDDL parser that can read XHTML that include built-in
transformation information using XSLT.  This set of scraping
tools development is ongoing.
</p><p>Redland provides multiple backends for storing RDF graphs, using a
<span class="emphasis"><i class="emphasis">storage</i></span> interface abstraction.  The choice of
storage can depend not only on the system that Redland is configured
and built on, but on the features they provide as they include a
range of stores going from in-memory storage without indexes,
persistent stores in static files, simple database files up to using
a relational database (MySQL).  The tradeoffs between the storage
modules and their different features are described in the
documentation.
</p></div><div class="section"><hr><h2 class="section"><a name="sec-contexts">6. Data Management and Tracking with Redland Contexts</a></h2><p>One frequent use of RDF data is to aggregate content from a variety of
data sources into one RDF graph (data store) and then to manipulate
and query the result.  At this point the user often wants to find out
where the result came from - which sources formed part of it.  Redland
provides a feature for managing this called contexts which allow sets
of triples in a data store to be marked with a URI when added and to
get back this URI when searching.  This enables this common problem
and also allows an additional one to be solved - updating a graph when
an original source content changes, as the contexts api allows removal
of all triples associated with a context, so that new data can be
loaded if need be.
</p><p>With Redland contexts, each triple can be marked as having multiple
nodes called <span class="emphasis"><i class="emphasis">context nodes</i></span> such as C1, C2.
These are regular Redland nodes so can appear in triples themselves.
<a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#contextgraph">Table 1</a> shows four triples that appear
in the the subject of two triples. The context nodes are assigned
when the triples are added to the Redland graph, but otherwise they
are no different from any other graph node.  The first 2 triples are
in context C1, and could be from the same graph.  Triples 1,3 and 4
are in context C2 and could be from a separate graph that was
aggregated.  The last two triples provide extra information about
the contexts (graphs) themselves such as where, when they were
added to the Redland model or other data management information.
</p><div class="table"><a name="contextgraph"></a><p><b>Table 1. Redland RDF graph with contexts</b></p><table border="1" class="CALSTABLE"><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>&nbsp;</th><th>Triple</th><th>Contexts</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td>(s1, p1, o1)</td><td>C1, C2</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>(s2, p2, o2)</td><td>C1</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>(s3, p3, o3)</td><td>C2</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>(s4, p4, o4)</td><td>C2</td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>(C1, p5, o5)</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>(C2, p6, o6)</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This is made available by methods on the stream and iterator
classes after making an API call that returns them.  It allows getting
the context node for the current result - triple or node returned
from the stream.  In pseudo code, like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">  stream=model.find_statement(s, p, o)
  statement=stream.current()
  context_node=stream.context()
</pre><p>Methods of the model class provide additional contexts control
including listing all the context nodes in a graph, listing all the
triples with a given context and to bulk add/delete triples
associated with a context - a common use case.</p><p>Redland contexts can be used for several different techniques
of recording context depending on how the context nodes are
associated with the triples, which is application specific, and is
done at the time the triples are added to the graph. The uses could
include the following, although this is not an exhaustive
list:</p><p></p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt>Enable true graph merging / updating / demerging</dt><dd><p>Identify the subgraphs (sets of triples from
particular sources) with context nodes.</p></dd><dt>Triple Identity</dt><dd><p>Add each triple with a different context node. RDF's
model does not assign identity to triples. There is reification also
which might be used with this approach.</p></dd><dt>Triple Provenance</dt><dd><p>Use the context node as the subject of other triples
about the triple that is returned.</p></dd><dt>Subgraphs</dt><dd><p>Similar to the merging approach but consider the RDF
graph to be a set of graphs and manipulate them as
such.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="section"><hr><h2 class="section"><a name="sec-manipulation">7. RDF API - RDF Data Access and Manipulation</a></h2><p>The Redland API contains the full set of triple-level manipulation to
RDF graph, integrated with the parsing and serialising by streams
that provide access to a sequence of triples, which allows data to be
generated lazily, on-demand by the application where possible.  This
enables the use of a minimum of resources when performing model
operations or operating across a protocol or API.
</p><p>In addition to the low-level API calls to add a triple, remove a
triple and similar, the RDF graphs can be searched for patterns of
triples using a triple pattern matching call
<tt class="literal">find_statements</tt>:
</p><pre class="programlisting">  /* ... set statement parts to what is needed, leaving wildcards NULL .. */
  predicate = librdf_new_node_from_uri_string(world, "http;//example.org/pred");
  statement = librdf_new_statement_from_nodes(NULL, predicate, NULL);

  /* find matching triples in the graph ('model') matching statement */
  stream = librdf_model_find_statements(model, statement)
</pre><p>which gives a stream of RDF triple results (or in Python, a generator
of them; and in Perl, an array)
</p><p>This requires for more complex API interactions, quite a few objects,
classes and method calls.  This also means that the application
developer has to be involved with the detail of the API and cannot
express application-centric problems, in RDF terms such as graph
triples.  This has been solved in other areas by the development
of query languages, explained in the next section.
</p></div><div class="section"><hr><h2 class="section"><a name="sec-query">8. Query Languages - RDQL and SPARQL</a></h2><p>Query languages aid the application developer to do a lot of
data model access, selection and formatting in a compact format,
as well as provide a standardisation point for the developer
across multiple implementations.
Redland presently has support for two RDF query languages
<acronym class="acronym">RDQL</acronym><a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#RDQL">[RDQL]</a>
which has been a defacto standard
RDF query language for several years and
<acronym class="acronym">SPARQL</acronym> <a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#SPARQL">[SPARQL]</a>,
which is currently being standardised by the W3C RDF Data Access
Working Group (<acronym class="acronym">DAWG</acronym>).  The language is still under
development and the final syntax and feature set is not finally
decided.
</p><p>SPARQL was developed as a standard RDF query language, that is, with
RDF concepts at the core - triples and graphs and with support for
the unique requirements of the semantic web that have been found from
the earlier query language work.  These include supporting the
semi-structured nature and schemalessness of RDF by allowing queries
with optional parts to succeed (SPARQL <tt class="literal">OPTIONAL</tt>)
with partial matches and not requiring all the types of data to be
pre-declared before a query (as SQL does).
</p><p>SPARQL <tt class="literal">OPTIONAL</tt> allow such things as querying
for multiple properties of a resource in one go, without necessarily
requiring that all of them are present:
</p><div class="example"><a name="optionalex"></a><p><b>Example 4. SPARQL Optionals</b></p><pre class="programlisting">  PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
  SELECT ?name ?mbox
  WHERE  { ?r rdf:type foaf:Person }
	 OPTIONAL { ?r foaf:name  ?name }
	 OPTIONAL { ?r foaf:mbox  ?mbox }
</pre></div><p>which could find for each FOAF Person object,  bindings for
the names and email address, where known.  In a lower-level API
call this would typically need several queries or multiple API calls
to perform.
</p><p>The experience of running RDF query languages on the web led to
the language enabling web integration in several aspects.  The
contexts feature of Redland and similar implementations in some earlier
RDQL support was used to return information on where aggregated RDF
data came from originally, by tracking the source graph URIs.  SPARQL
makes this available both in forming queries and in binding
results by the <tt class="literal">GRAPH</tt> operator, taking either
a URI argument to restrict a query to triples from graph or
a variable, to return the provenance of a triple:
</p><div class="example"><a name="graphex"></a><p><b>Example 5. SPARQL <tt class="literal">GRAPH</tt></b></p><pre class="programlisting">  PREFIX foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/&gt;
  SELECT ?g ?name
  WHERE  { ?r rdf:type foaf:Person }
	 GRAPH ?g { ?r foaf:name  ?name }
</pre></div><p>which returns the names of the people (FOAF Person classes) in the graph
and the original graph in which the triple was found.  In common
semantic web applications where data is integrated, this allows the
application developer to deal with issues of provenance and trust
and data management.  Redland supports manipulating contexts which
maps directly to the <tt class="literal">GRAPH</tt> support.
</p><p>Finally SPARQL has a full set of supported operators on RDF literals,
simple XML Schema datatypes (plus a few others such as dateTime)
along with operators on them from XQuery Functions and Operators.
It also has several other features including creating RDF graphs
as results in addition to variable bindings, which allows novel
possibilities of chaining RDF graph creation.  Redland's query
language support is provided by Rasqal<a href="https://www.dajobe.org/papers/xtech2005/#Rasqal">[Rasqal]</a>
which lazily evaluates the queries, so that results are generated
and produced only as they are needed - streaming.
</p></div><div class="section"><hr><h2 class="section"><a name="sec-conclusion">9. Conclusion</a></h2><p>Redland is a mature FS/OSS C set of libraries providing a core RDF
